## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS - CSS Framework
- JavaScript & JSON

### What I learned

By completing this project, I was able to understand how easy is is to work with a figma or sketch design. It is my first experience working with figma.

I was able to understand how to work with figma. I understood the value of writing clean code and marking down code with comments. I was able to understand more profoundly how to work with json.

### Continued development

I am now looking forward to work on projects with more harder and advance than now. I wish to complete next project with grid only as I am not using it quite recently. Looking forward more challenging and advance project
